# Automating AWS Reporting with Bash Scripting

This repository contains a set of Bash scripts designed to automate the process of generating reports and analyzing AWS resources. The scripts help streamline tasks such as retrieving instance information, conducting cost analysis, and monitoring the utilization of various AWS resources.

## Features

- **Instance Information**: Retrieve detailed data about EC2 instances, including instance ID, type, state, and launch time.
- **Cost Analysis**: Perform cost analysis to identify spending trends, cost-saving opportunities, and budget overruns.
- **Resource Utilization Monitoring**: Monitor the utilization of AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.
- **Custom Reporting**: Generate reports tailored to specific business needs and requirements.

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions
- `jq` for JSON parsing
- Standard Linux/Unix utilities: `sed`, `awk`, `grep`

## Usage

1. **Log in to AWS from Ubuntu**: Follow this [guide](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/SignIn%20AWS%20EC2%20From%20ubuntu) to log in to your AWS virtual machine from an Ubuntu environment.
2. **Configure Your Text Editor**: Set up your preferred text editor. I recommend [VIM configuration](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/VIM-Configuration).
3. **Configure Your AWS Account**: Ensure your AWS account is configured by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/AWS%20Configure).
4. **Write and Edit Shell Scripts**: Learn how to write and edit Bash scripts [here](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/Shell%20Scripting).
5. **Send Reports via Email**: Use SMTP to send reports by following these [steps](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/Send%20Mail%20with%20SMTP).
6. **Automate with Cron Jobs**: Schedule the Bash scripts to run automatically with a [cron job](https://github.com/waliulrayhan/Automating-AWS-Reporting-with-Bash-Scripting/blob/main/Cron%20Job) for daily reporting.

## Configuration

Before running any script, ensure that the AWS CLI is properly configured with the necessary credentials and permissions. Some scripts may require customization to match your specific AWS environment or reporting needs. Review and adjust any variables or parameters as needed.
